This app demonstrates *Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE)* with a Random Forest Regressor to select the most important features for predicting startup funding amounts.

*How it works:*
1.  The indian_startup_founders.csv dataset is loaded.
2.  Categorical features are encoded into numbers.
3.  When you click the button below, the app will train a Random Forest model and use RFE to select the top 10 most influential features.
4.  Finally, it will display the selected features and the model's performance (Mean Squared Error).
